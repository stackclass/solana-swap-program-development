In this stage, you'll implement your own solution.

### Step 1: Implement solution

Head over to your editor / IDE and implement the tests in `tests/swap.ts`.

### Step 2: Run tests

To run tests, make changes to your code and run the following commands:

```sh
git add .
git commit --allow-empty -m "[any message]"
git push origin main
```
