  Learn to build a peer-to-peer token swap program on Solana blockchain.
  This beginner-friendly course covers everything from environment setup to
  deploying a secure swap smart contract using the Anchor framework.

  You will start with foundational concepts like Solana's account model,
  Rust programming for blockchain, and SPL tokens. Then you will progressively
  build a complete swap program featuring program-derived addresses (PDAs),
  secure token vaults, and proper escrow handling.

  The course emphasizes hands-on learning with Rust-based tests and practical
  exercises at every stage. By the end, you will have a fully functional
  decentralized exchange program that enables trustless token swaps between users.

  Topics covered include:
  - Solana development environment and Rust basics
  - SPL tokens and associated token accounts
  - Cross-Program Invocations (CPI) for token operations
  - Program-Derived Addresses (PDAs) for secure account management
  - Escrow patterns and vault security
  - Comprehensive testing with Rust
  - Production deployment best practices
