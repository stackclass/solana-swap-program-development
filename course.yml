short_name: Solana Swap
release_status: beta
description: |-
  Build a decentralized token swap program on the Solana blockchain. In this challenge,
  you'll create a secure, on-chain swap program using Anchor framework that allows
  users to create offers and swap tokens in a trustless manner.

  Along the way, you'll learn about Solana's account model, program-derived addresses (PDAs),
  cross-program invocations (CPI), SPL token integration, and on-chain state management.
  You'll also master Rust for Solana development and understand how to build secure,
  gas-efficient smart contracts.

  By the end, you'll have a fully functional swap dApp that demonstrates core
  Web3 concepts and Solana development best practices.
summary: Build a decentralized token swap program on Solana blockchain using Anchor framework
